    title: "Paris",
    describe:
      "France's magnetic City of Light is a perennial tourist destination, drawing visitors with its iconic attractions, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and its unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Quaint cafes, trendy shopping districts and Haussmann architecture give Paris its timeless beauty. But the city's best asset is that you're likely to discover something new with each trip or season (read: Paris is always a good idea). To best explore France's ever-changing capital, get lost wandering the charming cobblestone streets, learn its secrets on a walking tour, head to dynamic art exhibits like the Atelier des Lumières or gourmandize at the latest restaurants and pastry shops.",

    describe:
      "What this 12-square-mile French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here, you'll find picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts set on surrounding islets. The island's extinct volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion.

    describe:
      "When you visit Italy's capital city, prepare to cross a few must-see landmarks – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Travelers can also see some of Italy's greatest treasures, including St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, in Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds by taking a twilight stroll along the cobblestone streets of Trastevere, or head to Mercato Centrale Roma to sample local delicacies like pistachio gelato. Before leaving, peruse some of Rome's lesser-known museums, art galleries and boutiques, or head to Janiculum Hill for panoramic views of the city.",

    title: "Swiss Alps",
    describe:
      "Snow-covered mountains, charming towns and flower-strewn meadows make the Swiss Alps a year-round fairy tale destination. Visit in the winter for world-class skiing (and après-ski fondue and drinks) in locales such as the exclusive St. Moritz and the picturesque Zermatt, home of the craggy Matterhorn. Opt for warmer months to hike through the verdant valleys of Swiss National Park or attend lively festivals in the foothill city of Montreux. Regardless of the time of year, no trip would be complete without a visit to the Jungfrau Region, where you can experience idyllic mountain villages like Grindelwald and Mürren or take the Jungfrau Railway to Europe's highest railway station.",

      "London is a world unto itself. The eclectic neighborhoods, which are home to a blend of historical landmarks and modern-day attractions, can keep you occupied for days. If it's your first time in London, join a tour that takes you past top spots like the Tate Modern art institution, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, Borough Market and the British Museum, before sitting down to a classic afternoon tea or checking out a local pub for a Sunday roast. Once you've seen the major sights, stroll through the posh streets of Mayfair or Chelsea, or admire the gardens at one of London's 3,000 parks.",
